# Customer-Churn-Prediction
An end-to-end data analysis project to predict customer churn using Python, Scikit-learn, and Power BI.

# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

## Project Objective
This project analyzes a telecom company's customer data to identify the primary drivers of churn. The goal was to build a predictive model to flag at-risk customers and present the findings in a Power BI dashboard, leading to actionable retention strategies.

## Key Findings & Visualizations
The analysis revealed that customers are most likely to churn if they have:
* A **Month-to-Month Contract**.
* **Low Tenure** (they are a new customer).
* **High Monthly Charges**, especially with Fiber Optic internet.
* No **Tech Support** subscription.

## Actionable Recommendations
Based on the data, I recommend the following proactive strategies:
1.  **Target Month-to-Month Customers:** Launch a loyalty campaign offering a discount for switching to a one- or two-year contract.
2.  **Implement a New Customer Onboarding Program:** Since new customers are the most likely to leave, create an enhanced support program for their first three months.
3.  **Promote a Tech Support Add-on:** Offer a free trial of the tech support service to customers who do not currently have it.

## Tools & Libraries
* **Data Analysis & Modeling:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
* **Data Visualization & Reporting:** Power BI
